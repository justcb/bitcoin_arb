# bitcoin_arb
This analysis compares bitcoin prices on two different crypto exchanges and looks for price differences, seeking arbitrage opportunities.  There are very rare instances where the price of a crypto asset differs from one exchange to another.  However, in those instances, risk-free money is there for the analyst fast enough to identify it and execute on the information.  This bitcoin arbitration application assists in locating just such opportunities between two different exchanges.  Here, we are looking at bitfinance and coinbase.
